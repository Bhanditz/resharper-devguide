# Style guide

webhelp uses title case for heading, sentence case for sub headings

* Page headers - title case? (not at the minute)
* Sub headers - sentence case?


## Terms

(Based on what's used in webhelp)

Not normally capitalised. Perhaps capitalise the first occurrence?

* Alt+Enter, mono space
* Context Action
* Quick-Fix
* Code Cleanup

## Code examples

* Indent of 2. Be conservative with space
* Don't wrap unnecessarily, but don't leave really really long lines (column would be useful here)
* Allow blank lines for clarity
* Comment if necessary, but not for everything
