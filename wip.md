# Work in Progress

Notes to self.

* Not sure how to handle the testing section. Probably, an intro section, with the philosophy and the folder structure, perhaps looking at the base classes, then each derived class should be detailed in the appropriate location. Perhaps a quick links doc here
* Need to fix bug with book parts. Cannot have a 2nd level header in `summary.md` with a link, but no child items
* I'm not sure on having a folder structure, especially for sub-levels. I think each book part needs to be in its own folder, but sub-folders would cause breaking links if we move them around (mind you, renaming would also cause breakages...)
